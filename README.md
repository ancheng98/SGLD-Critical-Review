# SGLD-Critical-Review

Authors: Chung, Wesley and Cheng, Andrew

This paper is a final project for COMP 599 - Mathematical Technique in Machine Learning. 
The purpose of the project is to select a theoretical machine learning paper to critically review. 
We start with a brief history of SGLD along with a description of the algorithm. Then, the relevant prerequisites are
introduced. Next, we present the theorem stating its diffusion limit and its proof, fillling in details when necessary and adding our own remarks. Finally, we summarize our opinions and briefly discuss certain followup works on SGLD.
