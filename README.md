# SGLD-Critical-Review

Authors: Chung, Wesley and Cheng, Andrew

This paper is a final project for COMP 599 - Mathematical Techniques in Machine Learning. 
The purpose of the project is to select a theoretical machine learning paper to critically review. 

## Abstract
In this report, we discuss a paper by Teh et al. on the theoretical properties
of the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm [1], which was
first proposed by Welling and Teh [2]. We start with a brief history of SGLD
along with a description of the algorithm. Then, the relevant prerequisites are
introduced. Next, we present the theorem stating its diffusion limit and its
proof, filling in details when necessary and adding our own remarks. Finally, we
summarize our opinions and briey discuss certain followup works on SGLD.
